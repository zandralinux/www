# About
 
Zandra Linux is an independent musl-based Linux distribution based on
the principles of simplicity and efficiency, and composed entirely out
of  [free software](https://www.gnu.org/philosophy/free-sw.html). It
is a fork of [morpheus linux](http://morpheus.2f30.org). It uses Plan
9 mkfiles to build packages, with both a ports tree and a binary
package manager. All binaries are statically linked and there is no
systemd. Every aspect of the system tries to conform to the Unix
philosophy of "do one thing and do it well".

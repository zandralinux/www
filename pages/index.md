# About
 
Zandra Linux is an independent musl-based Linux distribution based on
the principles of simplicity and efficiency. It is a fork of
[morpheus linux](http://morpheus.2f30.org). It uses Plan 9 mkfiles to
build packages, with both a ports tree and a binary package manager.
All binaries are statically linked and there is no systemd. Every
aspect of the system tries to conform to the Unix philosophy of "do
one thing and do it well".

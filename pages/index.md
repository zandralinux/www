# About

Zandra Linux is a Linux distribution based on the principles of
simplicity and efficiency. It is a continuation of the Morpheus
Linux distribution.

## Project Goals

* Maintain a Plan 9 mk-based ports tree.
* Use a binary package manager.
* Have a stable release cycle.
* Compile static binaries.
* Distribute man pages for each program (even ones where man pages
  don't exist in the mainline repositories).
* Provide an option for installation with linux-libre and no proprietary
  firmware.
* Don't ship nonfree software with the (optional) exception of linux-firmware.
* No systemd.
* Link binaries to musl libc.
* Link binaries to LibreSSL.
* Provide a minimal default install.

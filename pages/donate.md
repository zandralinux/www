# Donate

If you'd like to help out the project, donating is only one of many
ways to do so, but it is important nonetheless. It shows support and
gratitude for the work done, and helps pay for things that would be
out of pocket. Donations are managed by Ben O'Neill, the lead
developer of Zandra Linux. They will be used for things such as server
bills and financing hardware for a development box that developers can
SSH into. They will not be used for anything unrelated to Zandra
development. You are not donating to the developers, you are donating
to the project. If you would like your donation to be reserved for a
specific thing, you can state that if the donation method has a note
option, or by emailing Ben afterwards with some sort of transaction
identifier. Questions or comments about donations can be sent to Ben
at [ben@zandra.xyz](mailto:ben@zandra.xyz). Thanks!

# Zandra FAQ

## What is Zandra?

Zandra is an independent musl-based Linux distribution based on the
principles of simplicity and efficiency, and composed almost entirely
out of free software. It is a fork of morpheus linux. It uses Plan 9
mkfiles to build packages, with both a ports tree and a binary package
manager. All binaries are statically linked. Every aspect of the
system tries to conform to the Unix philosophy of "do one thing and do
it well". Compact and easy-to-understand codebases are also heavily
prioritized. In order to stick to our philosophy in an elegant and
practical manner, software such as systemd, electron, and huge desktop
environments like GNOME and KDE are intentionally not supported in the
system, among others.

## Why use Zandra?

If you are an experienced computer user who is tired of deeply
planted dependencies and unreasonably high memory usage, but also want
to build your system from the ground up to cater to your needs, Zandra
is probably right for you. If any part of the previous statement is
inaccurate, Zandra is almost definitely not right for you.

## How can I contribute to Zandra?

There are many ways. There is a to-do list on the main git repository.
That's a good place to start. You can also port software to Zandra or
write documentation. Spreading the word is always great as well.

## How can I donate to Zandra?

Sadly, you cannot donate to Zandra yet. Cryptocurrency will probably
be the primary method in the future, though.

## Why is Zandra labelled as a Linux distribution instead of a GNU/Linux distribution?

Zandra's base system contains no GNU programs. To call Zandra a distribution
of GNU/Linux doesn't make sense, but of course GNU packages are provided in
Zandra's repositories.

## Where can I send my questions, comments, or suggestions?

You can write directly to the lead dev of Zandra at "ben at thisdomain" or
use the IRC channel `#zandra` on Freenode.
